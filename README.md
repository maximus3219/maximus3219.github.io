This model has been trained to recognize one of the following myxoid lesions:
- Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma
- Intramuscular myxoma
- Low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma
- Myxofibrosarcoma
- Myxoid liposarcoma

It has been evaluated to have an accuracy of 98.9%.

Currently, please use Microsoft Edge on desktop or Safari on iPhone as the web browser, as using Chrome on desktop has been found to give wrong result.

For optimal use, please upload the most representative images for the lesion, taken at 20X objectives.

If you are using iphone to take photos, please try zooming in to get an image fully filling up the screen.

Images from diagnoses other than the ones listed above will surely give wrong results.
